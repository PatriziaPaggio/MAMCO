# MAMCO

This repository contains a zipped archived with annotations of 12
video-recorded Maltese conversations. The annotations were created
manually using the ANVIL 6.0 tool for video annotation 
(http://www.anvil-software.de), and follow the xml format used by the tool.

All annotations use the same annotation specification file
anvil-spec-MAMCO-v3.xml, which defines all the relevant annotation
attributes and values.

The following annotation tracks have been annotated for all the
conversations:

words: 	      		 word-aligned orthographic transcription;

translation:		   utterance-aligned English translation;

HeadMovements:		 annotation of head movement type.

All head movements were annotated by two expert annotators (in some cases 
with input from research assistants). One minute from one of the dialogues 
(dialogue c, both speakers) was annotated by both expert coders and used 
to run an inter-annotator agreement test.

The results of the test, averaged for both speakers, are as follows.

Percentage = 89.9281

Cohen's kappa = 0.5402

Corrected kappa = 0.8881

K's alfa = 0.54745


For some of the conversations, very limited annotations are also
available of tunes and hand gestures, both in general (HandGesture
track) and in connection with extracted complements (HandGestureTopic
track).


The video recordings that the annotations refer to are available on request 
for research purposes.
